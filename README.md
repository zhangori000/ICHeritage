# Sanity and Next.js

This is a [Sanity.io](https://sanity.io) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project created following a Course on [Sanity Learn](https://sanity.io/learn).

I used the above template to begin the foundation for ICHeritage. This allows for the owner of ICHeritage to modify content of this without contacting developer all the time

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
- Open [http://localhost:3000/studio](http://localhost:3000/studio) to edit content.
